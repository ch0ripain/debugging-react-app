# 🐛 Debugging React App

## Debugging Methods

### 1. Using the Browser Console 🖥️

The first method is to check the browser's error console. Here, you can find the type of error, the exact line of code, and other useful information that helps you locate and fix the issue.

> [!TIP]
> The console is your first go-to for quick details on any unexpected error.

### 2. Browser Developer Tools 🧰

Another way is to leverage the browser’s developer tools, especially the **Source** tab. Here, you can see your entire project structure and navigate between files. 
With **breakpoints**, you can monitor values and follow the flow of your code, checking if data is correctly passed between components for example.

> [!TIP]
>  Place breakpoints strategically to track data flow and better understand your app’s behavior.

### 3. React Extensions 🔍

Use extensions like **React Developer Tools**. This tool allows you to see your entire component structure. 
By clicking on a component, you can inspect its state, props, and functions, and even modify values in real-time to observe your app’s response.

> [!TIP]
>  The **Components** view in React DevTools is ideal for analyzing each component's state and props throughout your app.

## Conclusion 📝

These three methods, combined with your programming logic and debugging experience, will make code troubleshooting faster and more efficient. 
Additionally, they’ll give you a deeper understanding of your app.
